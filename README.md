#Sortieralgorithmen 
This is a basic repository for Data structures and Algorithmen.
There are 2 kind of test posibillities.
In the Folder "Beispielinstanzen" are small Files with some random Numbers in it.
In the Folder "Testinstanzen" are big Files with many random Numbers, so you can test the Algortihm and their time.

## Algorithm Test
to test one of the Algorithms just type this :

##### 1. Compile Your Code 
First You should compile the files with `javac` in your Terminal
One example could look like this : 
`javac InsertionSort.java`

##### 2. Choose a Test File 
You need an argument when starting the application.
The Files are under *./"Beispielinstanzen"* or *./"Testinstanzen"* for bigger ones

##### 3. Start Application 
To start an Application you need to run the command `java` following with the application **class File** and the Test File as an argument.
An example could look like this 
`java InsertionSort Beispielinstanzen/example1.txt`
